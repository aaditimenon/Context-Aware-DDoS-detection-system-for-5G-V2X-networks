# Context-Aware-DDoS-detection-system-for-5G-V2X-networks

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** for **5G-V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything)** communication networks.
It combines **Stage 1: Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection** with **Stage 2: V2X Performance Simulation** to detect malicious activities and evaluate their impact on vehicular safety and communication efficiency.

The system aims to improve **security, reliability, and safety** of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) by detecting attacks in real-time and analyzing their effect on decision-making, throughput, and collision risk.

## 🚦 Project Stages

### **Stage 1: Intrusion Detection**

* Dataset: Preprocessed network traffic dataset.
* Model: Random Forest classifier.
* Features: Forward/Backward packet statistics, protocol, throughput ratios, etc.
* Output: Binary classification (**Attack** vs. **Benign**).
* Evaluation: Confusion matrix, classification report, feature importance plots.

### **Stage 2: V2X Simulation**

* Dataset: Preprocessed V2X communication dataset (with GPS, LiDAR, radar, packet metrics, latency, throughput, etc.).
* Stage 1’s IDS output is integrated with vehicle communication.
* Evaluates how blocking malicious packets affects:

  * **Decision Accuracy**
  * **Obstacle Detection Accuracy**
  * **Collision Rates**
  * **Throughput & Latency**
